"""Fetch arXiv:2605.20919v2 into replication_target/.

The **primary** download is the arXiv LaTeX / e-print **source**
(arxiv.org/src/...). It is far more token-efficient to read than the rendered
HTML (which embeds figures as huge base64 data-URIs you would otherwise have to
strip) and the .tex files read cleanly. It is also where authors most often
ship a reproduction recipe -- a SKILL.md / AGENTS.md, a reproduce/replicate/
run.sh script, a Makefile target, a Dockerfile, or a link to a replication zip
-- usually near the end of the paper.

This script downloads the source archive, extracts it to
``replication_target/source/`` (committed), saves the PDF as a fallback /
complete record (gitignored), and prints any files that look like a
reproduction recipe so the agent can find and run it FIRST.

arXiv submissions come in a few shapes; all are handled:
  * a gzip-compressed tar (the common case: many files)  -> extracted
  * a single gzip-compressed .tex (single-file paper)    -> source/main.tex
  * a PDF-only submission (no source available)          -> paper.pdf

arXiv rate-limits (HTTP 429/503), so requests retry with backoff that honours
the Retry-After header. Stdlib only.
