# replicating-sutra-tensor-op-rnns-as-a-compilation-target - Work Queue

**This file is a queue of concrete, executable steps, not a state snapshot.**
Finished work lives in `devlog.md` (dated entries) and `git log`;
longer-horizon items live in `todo.md`. **When an item is done, delete it
from this file AND append a dated entry to `devlog.md` in the same commit,
then push.** No checkmarks, no status indicators in place.

**Why this file exists:** the replication plan is written here BEFORE
execution so an interrupted session resumes from the queue, not from chat.
The canonical methodology is `SKILL.md`; this queue is its executable form.

## Active — Replicate "Sutra: Tensor-Op RNNs as a Compilation Target for Vector Symbolic Architectures" (arXiv:2605.20919)

The scaffold already made commit 1 (the framework) AND commit 2 (the extracted
arXiv source). The efficient path is: read the source, **find and run the
authors' reproduction recipe FIRST**, then verify its output against the paper
and fill only the gaps. From-scratch reimplementation is the fallback, not the
default. Work top to bottom; delete each item in the same commit that completes
it (and append to `devlog.md`).

1. **STOP — get explicit user consent before running ANY external/cloned code.**
   This is the first thing you do, before anything else. Replicating this paper
   means executing code you did not write: the authors' reproduction recipe /
   replication scripts, a cloned repo, a downloaded zip. Per harness safety
   requirements, **ask the user for explicit consent to run such code and wait
   for their answer before executing any of it.** Reading the paper, the
   `source/`, and the recipe text is fine — *running* third-party code is the
   gated action. (Downloading the arXiv source and extracting the tarball is
   plain data handling, already done by the scaffolder, and is not gated.) An
   automated security scan of the code before running is a future enhancement
   (see `todo.md`); for now, only proceed if the user trusts the source.

2. **Read the already-extracted source.** The scaffolder downloaded the arXiv
   **e-print source** (https://arxiv.org/src/2605.20919v2) and committed it to `replication_target/source/`
   (commit 2) — far cheaper to read than the rendered HTML, which embeds figures
   as huge base64 blobs. Read the paper straight from the `.tex` in `source/` —
   no HTML→markdown step. (If `source/` is empty — e.g. the scaffold ran offline,
   or the paper is PDF-only — run `python download_paper.py` now and commit it;
   that is a plain download, not third-party code, so it is not gated.)

3. **Create the GitHub repo and push — now, not at the end.** Create a PUBLIC
   repo and push: `gh repo create --public --source=. --push` (public is
   required for free GitHub Pages). From here on every commit pushes, so CI and
   Pages build as you go. (This is the step the v1.4.0 flow missed — the
   replication ran entirely locally and never went live.)

4. **Before any deep analysis: find the reproduction recipe in the source.**
   This is the highest-leverage step and it comes before reading the whole
   paper. Authors very often ship a recipe right in the e-print source —
   usually near the end of the paper: a `SKILL.md` / `AGENTS.md`, a
   `reproduce.*` / `replicate.*` / `run.sh` script, a `Makefile` reproduce
   target, a Dockerfile, or a **replication zip** referenced in the text.
   `download_paper.py` prints candidate files; also grep the `.tex` in `source/`
   for "reproduc", "replicat", "skill", "github.com", and asset/zip URLs.
   - Found a **skill/recipe file** → copy it to the repo root as
     `replication_skill.md` and commit.
   - Found a **replication zip** (in the source or linked in the paper) →
     download/extract it into `replication/` (add the zip to `.gitignore`,
     commit the extracted contents).
   - Found the **authors' code repo** → add it as a git submodule under
     `replication_target/` and record the decision in `notes/sources.md`.
   - Found nothing → note that in `notes/sources.md`; the rest of the queue is
     your from-scratch path.

5. **If a recipe exists, RUN IT FIRST and let it drive the rest.** (Only after
   the user's consent from step 1.) Set up just enough environment to execute
   it, run it, and capture its output into
   `results/`. Then read the paper and assess **how much of the headline claims
   the recipe's output actually reproduces** — which numbers/figures it covers
   and which it doesn't. Record this in `notes/sources.md`. With a working
   recipe, most of what follows is *verifying its output against the paper*, not
   reimplementing from scratch. Commit.

6. **Check ALL references — always, recipe or not.** Walk the bibliography and
   confirm the key cited results / datasets / baselines the paper leans on
   actually say what the paper claims. This runs in every replication. Record
   anything load-bearing or surprising in `notes/claims.md`. Commit.

7. **Record `notes/claims.md`** — scoped to whatever the recipe did NOT already
   cover: headline claim(s); datasets (version/hash, where they live);
   models/methods in re-implementable detail; evaluation metrics and the exact
   reported numbers; compute envelope (GPU type, hours, memory — decides if CI
   can auto-run it). If the recipe covered everything, this is a short
   confirmation. Commit.

8. **Reimplement only the uncovered claims** under `src/` (skip anything the
   recipe already reproduced; scope to the headline claim, not every ablation).
   Pin the environment in `requirements.txt` / `environment.yml` to versions
   that work. Commit as you go.

9. **Run the full replication** via `scripts/run.py` (the CI entry point);
   capture metrics as JSON into `results/`. Commit.

10. **Write `FINDINGS.md`:** reproduced vs. reported numbers (table); what the
    recipe covered vs. what you filled; gaps (hyperparameters, preprocessing,
    omitted architecture details) and where/why it diverged. Commit and push.

11. **Publish and finish.** Confirm `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (site + PDF
    report) and `.github/workflows/package.yml` (ZIP) run green; set
    Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions. Keep `SKILL.md` (and
    `replication_skill.md`, if you found one) truthful to what you actually did.
    **Stop / hand back** when `FINDINGS.md` reports at least one headline number
    with its reproduced value, `scripts/run.py` runs end-to-end from a clean
    clone (or documents the un-automatable data step), the repo is public and
    pushed, and the Pages deployment is green.
