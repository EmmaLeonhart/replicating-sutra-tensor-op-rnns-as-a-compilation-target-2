"""Formal-verification tooling: the GENERAL polynomial-obligation checker.

`fv_poly_bound.py` discharges the branch-range obligation for the three
*primitive* Kleene connectives. This module generalises it: it takes an
ARBITRARY Sutra expression built from the Kleene connectives `&&`, `||`, `!`
(and direct `logical_and`/`logical_or`/`logical_not` calls), nested to any
depth, and discharges obligations on it — without a hand-copied polynomial.

How it stays faithful to what the compiler actually emits
---------------------------------------------------------
It does not re-derive the connective formulas. It runs the compiler's OWN
lowering pass (`inline_stdlib_calls`, the same pass `translate_module` uses)
on the parsed expression, then walks the resulting *arithmetic* AST — the
exact tree the codegen turns into tensor ops — into a sympy polynomial. The
only nodes it accepts are the ones the inliner produces for pure Kleene logic:
`BinaryOp` (`+`/`-`/`*`, and `/` by a constant), `Parenthesized`, `Identifier`,
and integer/float literals.

The honest boundary (CLAUDE.md §"Integrity"): any node it cannot reduce to a
polynomial — a comparison (`==`/`>`/`<`), or an intrinsic call (`make_real`,
`bind`, `bundle`, an embedding-model invocation) — makes it RAISE
`NonPolynomialResidual`. It never guesses a value for a term it does not
understand. So the fragment it covers is exactly the pure-Kleene-logic one,
named rather than papered over.

Obligations it discharges on that fragment
------------------------------------------
- ``reduces_to_same_graph`` — the Pillar-1 *reduction* notion: do two
  expressions reduce to the SAME tensor graph? Decided by polynomial identity
  (``expand(p1 - p2) == 0``). This is the notion the paper's "semantically
  equivalent programs reduce to the same graph" claim is about, and it is
  exact and decidable for this fragment.
- ``kleene_equivalent`` — the *three-valued-logic* notion: do two expressions
  agree at every point of the {-1, 0, +1}^n Kleene grid? Decided by evaluating
  both polynomials on the finite grid.
- ``check_branch_range`` — the §3.2 branch-range obligation: the exact range
  of the reduced polynomial over [-1, +1]^n.

These two equivalence notions are NOT the same, and the difference is a real
result, not a wrinkle. Example: distributivity, ``a && (b || c)`` vs
``(a && b) || (a && c)``, is ``kleene_equivalent`` (the two agree at all 27
grid points — Kleene logic is a distributive lattice) but NOT
``reduces_to_same_graph`` (their polynomial interpolants differ off-grid, so
the reduced tensor graphs differ). De Morgan and commutativity, by contrast,
are both — they reduce to identical polynomials. So the polynomial reduction
canonicalises *some* logical equivalences but not all; distributivity is a
concrete witness that "reduce to the same graph" is strictly stronger than
"logically equivalent." (See planning/findings/2026-05-24-distributivity-not-
canonical.md.)

Scope/limit (measured, not hidden): ``check_branch_range`` solves a
critical-point system per box face with sympy; for deeply nested expressions
over 4+ variables the reduced polynomial's degree grows (the §3.4
expression/degree growth) and the solve becomes intractable / hangs. The
bounder is reliable for the primitive connectives and shallow nestings over a
few variables; it does NOT currently scale to deep, high-variable nesting. The
two equivalence checks above do NOT have this problem (identity and grid
evaluation are cheap).

Callers that need to trust a result against the substrate (not just against
the inliner) should also cross-check the extracted polynomial against a
compiled run — see ``tests/test_fv_general_checker.py``.
