"""Formal-verification tooling for Sutra — the public API.

This is the supported entry point to Sutra's formal-verification checks. Import
it as a package facade rather than reaching into module internals:

    from sutra_compiler import fv

    # Decide whether two Kleene-logic expressions reduce to the SAME tensor
    # graph (polynomial identity) — exact, any nesting depth:
    fv.reduces_to_same_graph("!(a && b)", "!a || !b", ["a", "b"])   # True
    fv.reduces_to_same_graph("a && (b || c)",
                             "(a && b) || (a && c)", ["a", "b", "c"])  # False

    # Decide three-valued (Kleene-grid) logical equivalence:
    fv.kleene_equivalent("a && (b || c)",
                         "(a && b) || (a && c)", ["a", "b", "c"])      # True

    # Branch-range obligation: exact range of a reduced polynomial over the
    # truth domain [-1, +1]^n (RangeBound.within(-1, 1) decides soundness):
    fv.check_branch_range("a && b", ["a", "b"]).within(-1, 1)          # True

Needs the optional dependency sympy:  pip install sutra-dev[fv]

Background: paper/formal-verification/paper.md (the framework + results) and
planning/sutra-spec/formal-verification.md (the obligation spec). The checks here
operate on the compiler's OWN lowering of an expression, and the obligation/
range results are cross-checked against the compiled substrate in the test suite
(tests/test_fv_general_checker.py, test_fv_poly_obligation_checker.py).
