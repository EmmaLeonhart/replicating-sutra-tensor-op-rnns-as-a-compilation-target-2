"""Sutra language compiler / validator.

This package implements the first pass of the Sutra SDK: a lexer,
parser, and syntactic validator for `.su` source files.

Scope (v0.1):
    - Full tokenization of Sutra source (all comment forms, string
      interpolation, numeric literals, identifiers, operators).
    - Recursive-descent parser that recognizes the declaration and
      statement grammar described in planning/sutra-spec/. The
      historical predecessor — sutra-syntax-decisions.md, the
      rolling decisions log that preceded the formal spec — lives
      under planning/sutra-spec-deprecated/ as read-only reference.
    - Structural validation: balanced brackets, semicolons where the
      grammar requires them, well-formed declarations and control flow.
    - A small set of rule checks that the syntax-decisions doc makes
      explicit (e.g. `var TYPE x` is forbidden, `if (...)` requires
      parentheses, a bare identifier cannot be used as a condition).

Out of scope for v0.1:
    - Type checking
    - Name resolution across files
    - Code generation / runtime lowering
    - Cross-file workspace analysis

The compiler is intentionally liberal where the spec is still open
(anonymous functions, pipe operator, etc.) - it accepts the documented
forms and flags the clearly-forbidden ones.
