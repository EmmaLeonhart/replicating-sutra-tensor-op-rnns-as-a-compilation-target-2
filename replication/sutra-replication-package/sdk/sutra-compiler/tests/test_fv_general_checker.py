"""Formal-verification artifact: the GENERAL polynomial-obligation checker.

`fv_poly_bound` discharges obligations for the three *primitive* Kleene
connectives. `fv_obligation_checker` generalises to ARBITRARY Kleene
expressions (`&&`/`||`/`!`, any depth) by running the compiler's own inliner
and walking the lowered arithmetic into a sympy polynomial. What it discharges,
and the honest limits, are below — every claim here is checked by a real run.

Two equivalence notions, and why they differ (a real result):
  * `reduces_to_same_graph` — polynomial identity (same tensor graph, agree
    everywhere on [-1,1]^n). The notion behind the paper's canonicalisation
    claim.
  * `kleene_equivalent` — agree on the {-1,0,+1}^n grid (three-valued logic).
  Distributivity is `kleene_equivalent` but NOT `reduces_to_same_graph`: equal
  on the grid, different polynomials off-grid. De Morgan/commutativity are
  both. So the reduction canonicalises some equivalences, not all.

Honest scope (measured): `check_branch_range` solves a critical-point system
per box face; it is reliable for the primitive connectives and shallow
2-variable nestings, but for deep 4+-variable nestings the polynomial degree
grows (the §3.4 explosion) and the sympy solve becomes intractable — so this
test bounds only the tractable cases and does NOT pretend the bounder scales.
The equivalence checks have no such limit (identity / grid eval are cheap).

Integrity guard (CLAUDE.md §"Integrity"): the polynomial is extracted from the
inliner, but the obligation is about what the SUBSTRATE computes.
`test_extracted_polynomial_matches_substrate` compiles a sample expression and
checks the extracted polynomial against the real torch substrate on the grid,
via exact `.subs` (no lambdify), before the result is trusted.
