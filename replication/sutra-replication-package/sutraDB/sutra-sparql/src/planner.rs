//! Cost-based query planner with pattern reordering and predicate pushdown.
//!
//! Implements a greedy heuristic for triple pattern reordering that combines
//! structural analysis (bound/unbound positions) with cardinality estimation
//! from the triple store's indexes. This is the SPARQL equivalent of a SQL
//! query optimizer choosing between index scan and sequential scan.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! **Why greedy instead of dynamic programming?**
//! SPARQL queries typically have 3-10 patterns. Greedy O(n²) is fast enough
//! and produces near-optimal orderings because the bound/unbound heuristic
//! already captures most of the selectivity signal. DP would be warranted
//! for 20+ pattern queries, which are rare in practice.
//!
//! **Why combine heuristic weight with cardinality?**
//! Pure cardinality-based ordering can make bad decisions when a pattern
//! produces few results but leaves many variables unbound (forcing later
//! patterns into full scans). The heuristic weight captures structural
//! selectivity, while cardinality captures data-dependent selectivity.
//! The final cost multiplies both signals: cost = heuristic_weight * cardinality.
//!
//! **Predicate pushdown:**
//! FILTERs are repositioned immediately after the pattern that binds their
//! last required variable. This is critical for performance — a FILTER on
//! `?age > 25` that runs after 10,000 intermediate rows is much cheaper
//! when pushed down to run after the 50 rows that bind `?age`.
